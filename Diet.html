    <div id="Healthy Diet">
        <h id="Recipe_color">Healthy Diet</h2>
        <p> A healthy diet is a diet that helps to maintain or improve overall health. 
            A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate calories.
        For people who are healthy, a healthy diet is not complicated and contains mostly fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes 
            little to no processed food and sweetened beverages. 
            The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-animal source of
             vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet.
            A healthy lifestyle may lower disease risks, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cancer.
